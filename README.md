Project 3 was an interactive system that allowed users to access and contribute publicly. Myself and Haley Lonnemo chose forced Lyft conversations as the premise of our project. What is interesting about this specific interaction is the genuinity of a person's behavior or words. We tested out a similar system to Lyft in which we sit two people down to talk about a topic for three minutes without stopping while also rating them during the conversation, not after. Would the ability to see how someone is actively rating you change the way you speak or engage with the other person?
